General Notes for File Handling in Python 

Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.

The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:

"r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

"a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

"w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

"x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

"t" - Text - Default value. Text mode

"b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)

"a" - Append - will append to the end of the file

"w" - Write - will overwrite any existing content

readline() :return one line by using the readline() method:

Syntax
f = open("demofile.txt") #open a file for reading

Example
f = open("demofile.txt", "r")
print(f.read())    #opeining demofile.txt in read mode that returns whole content
print(f.read(5))   #returns first 5 character 

Creating empty file

f = open("myfile.txt", "x")

delete file

import os
os.remove("demofile.txt")
